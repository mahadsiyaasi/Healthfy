1.0 introduction 
Study of healthcare and financial management systems is fascinating and rewarding. It is fascinating because so many of the concepts involved have implications for both professional and personal behavior. It is rewarding because the healthcare environment today, and in the foreseeable future, is forcing managers to place increasing emphasis on financial implications when making operating decisions. First and foremost, financial management is a decision science. Whereas accounting provides decision makers with a rational means by which to budget for and measure a business’s financial performance, financial management provides  systemized financial by specific date and the theories about how systems are dealing with real life solution , concepts, and tools necessary to make better decisions. 
Thus, the primary purpose of this book and its system is to help healthcare managers and health staff to do less work with efficient time and managers to take better decisions for their health’s outcome. The system is designed primarily for financial managers, although financial specialists—especially those with accounting rather than finance backgrounds or those moving into the health services industry from other industries—will also find the records useful. 
This health centers and their managers almost use by manual approach and its time killing without progress, it will be necessary countless number of staffs. Thus this system is very useful for health services and other similar hospitals to handle and maintain their work by daily schedule with systems tools.
Main features of the chapter are background of the problem, problem statement, and project scope and report organization. 
1.1 	Background of the problem 
Until the 1960s, health care centers with financial management systems  in all industries was generally viewed as descriptive in nature, its primary role being to secure the financing needed to meet a patients operating  systems , or planning, department would project demand for the health’s  services or facilities 
Managers would estimate the assets needed to meet the projected demand; and the finance department would raise the money needed to purchase the required tools, buildings, equipment, and supplies. The study of financial management concentrated on health’s development and society safety reliable way that can easy growth health finance and works monthly  fees.
African countries have large medical centers and they expanded access to healthcare in the region. The centers have financial systems and focus on needs to be on building robust systems resilient to the next generation of healthcare challenges.


In Somalia they still using manually systems for the prescriptions, checking patients records, appointments and even health fees that cause dissatisfaction or inconvenient between health managers and health staff or even  patients and that has serious  economic impacts. It disrupts continuity of health care, delays treatment, and affects to patients 
In turn of appointment for the patients, a study revealed that missed appointment was the most significant factor related to treatment failure. Furthermore, it deprives other patients of earlier appointments which affect other patient’s quality of health center. Economically, missed appointment and late prescriptions have significant impact on the ability to provide efficient and effective out rental services. It results in wasting financial, social costs and wasting time.

This system will online every time by the internet so patients can easy order any doctor they desired as online appointment and take hours with appointed doctor and later they can visit to the doctor for live meeting with his center. In this way  missing appointment, lost files, financial  decrease  all that things will solve  through daily  system track and then when the patients returns to the health all his medical record will be easily printable way from the system and even easy transferable to any other health center or hospitals to review patient medication status.
1.2	Problem statement 
Since advanced health system are core value of live and its maintaining society health it’s very important our hospitals to have that systems so the problem that will solve  this system is the old system’s venerability and data misleading to reproduce good data managing,
Old systems problems are -	
•	Less data backups
•	No online orders
•	Les multi - serving system usability
•	Lock of usage API ’s and less security controls
This system will eliminate all these vulnerabilities and it will take advance such features – 
•	Server up and running by  24 hours 
•	Dedicated auto data backups 
•	Online Appointment with any doctor
•	Freelancer doctor with patients without dependent to hospitals
•	Delivery drugs and medicine prescriptions to customers’ homes 
1.3	Project Purpose 
Computer and many other machines are devices that can take information from you to system. This information can be used to obtain the valuable healthcare information. The personal health monitoring of each individual is considered very important because of rise in health problems in today's world. The increasing stressful lifestyle is taking maximum toll on the public health. With the ever increasing queues at hospitals and ever increasing number of patients, the doctor fees have sky-rocketed which is affecting especially those patients who cannot afford the fee or who are not suffering from major ailments but get to know so only after paying a hefty fee to the doctor. 
 
The System will basically consists of four different users that would be interacting with the aim of providing better healthcare service through mutual utilization of self-monitoring and the consultation from a specialist. The mutual interaction exists because user will have the option of sending the data for analysis to the doctor, getting the feedback and then acting on his advice. The four users are:-
 
1. Patient
2. Doctor
3. Administrator
4. Staff
 
The Patient will register himself with system initially by providing the various personal details that includes his name, age, sex ,etc., along with the doctor’s name with which he wants to consult ,if at all. The registration part is mandatory before the user is able to use the system for his task completion. Then the user proceeds with login using his/her unique id and password. 
(_name _gender _birthdate _country _state _address)
 
The role of doctor is vital to any healthcare process and would provide the provision in our project to get doctors feedback .The patient should be able to send the report to the doctor, who was specified by the customer during his/her registration. But this functionality should be entirely upon the discretion of the user that whether he/she chooses doctor’s analysis or not. If the customer feels, he/she is satisfied with his improvement and performance after monitoring the data provided by our application, then patient can logout of the system.
  
The role of administrator should be limited to the validation of authenticity of the patient or the doctor. The parameters that admin would use for validating the authenticity of the doctors are external to the project and not in its scope.

 The role of Staff should be limited to the lab process of patients and entry to the system result from doctor to the patients after analysis, working with doctor to make doctor’s activity easy of the patient. The parameters that staff would use for specific permissions that would be under main doctor and will act health nurses that always helps to the doctors.

The designed application will be extremely user friendly since the users can be of any age. Simplicity in presenting the application to the user will be the key to success of this system.


1.4	Project Objective
It helps you to store the Information about patient and as well to search the details about the patient by having patient id whenever it’s necessary for the admin.
 It helps admin to store or maintain all the information about the staff and they can search the staff details by having staff id as well as delete/update the staff details.  It helps you to Create Bill for inpatient/ out patient, diagnosis, laboratory etc.  It helps to maintain all the details of the Inpatient and can search all inpatient details by having patient id. It helps to add Outpatient Details. 
Health center will probably manage their income fees with special financial management systems integrated to the health systems that have chart of accounts, general journal, ledger and monthly complete financial statement.
It helps health centers to maintain records based on details and any information about Patient, Staff, Diagnosis, OP etc. so that one can easily access it and thereby reducing different complexities. User Friendly with accessing menus. Leave Report of employees. Salary Updating of employees. Help is there, whenever needed any one can go through the help page and work in the application according to his need
1.5	Project Scope
This project of financial integrated health management system will be developed for Nora Health services in Somalia to manage entire information for the patient, staffs, admins and doctors. This is a research project for undergraduate level the researcher will develop it within six months using PHP frameworks as front end and MYSQL server as back end.
1.6	Significant of project
The point of view of this system is so clear, because it will provide essential health and its system tools that people of Somalia especially  needs to get core value of system  that hold their health records every time , payments and information about them. The health will benefit from this project to manage their own data about the tenant.

Making easy process of finding the information will increase the competition between the health cares. In order to be at the top ranking you must provide online health systems to your patients like this project to satisfy them as possible; and this will affect the overall level of health places in Somalia. This project will have direct and indirect impact on the society. 

This will help hospitals address unscheduled care needs with an easy to implement virtual medicine solution while providing patients with additional points of entry to your health system by offering 24/7 access to actively practicing emergency medicine providers.
1.7	Report Organization

Chapter Two
Literature Review
2.0	Introduction  
In this chapter will discuss the literature review of this web application (health integrated financial management system) as a case study also this system will discuss the conceptual and theoretical development of health system which means this system will be the leading and important aspect about many deferent sides like changing how patient get up early and go hospitals to find doctor number and it take long procedure to meet with the doctor. For that time taken process this system will let patients to get online booking  example they may can go our web link register them self as a new patient and then select every health doctor they want with  list of health centers  and then select time to appointment with a doctor.
2.1	Theoretical and Conceptual Theories   
The word "health" refers to a state of complete emotional and physical well-being. Healthcare exists to help people maintain this optimal state of health.
"Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity." WHO, 1948”.
2.1.1 	Health types
Mental and physical healthy are the two most commonly discussed types of health. Also talk about "spiritual health," "emotional health," and "financial health," among others. These have also been linked to lower stress levels and mental and physical wellbeing.
2.1.2	Physical Health  
In a person who experiences physical health, bodily functions are working at peak performance, due not only to a lack of disease, but also to regular exercise, balanced nutrition, and adequate rest and receive treatment, when necessary, to maintain the balance.
Physical wellbeing involves pursuing a healthful lifestyle to decrease the risk of disease. Maintaining physical fitness, for example, can protect and develop the endurance of a person's breathing and heart function, muscular strength, flexibility, and body composition.
Physical health and well-being also help reduce the risk of an injury or health issue. Examples include minimizing hazards in the workplace, practicing safe sex, practicing good hygiene, or avoiding the use of tobacco, alcohol, or illegal drugs.



2.1.3	Mental Health
Mental health refers to a person's emotional, social, and psychological wellbeing. Mental health is as important as physical health to a full, active lifestyle.
It is harder to define mental health than physical health, because, in many cases, diagnosis depends on the individual's perception of their experience. With improvements in testing, however, some signs of some types of mental illness are now becoming "visible" in CT scans and genetic testing.
Mental health is not only the absence of depression, anxiety, or another disorder.
It also depends on the ability to:
 
•	after difficult experiences
•	achieve balance
•	adapt to adversity
•	feel safe and secure
•	achieve your potential
 
Physical and mental health are linked. If chronic illness affects a person's ability to complete their regular tasks, this may lead to depression and stress, for example, due to money problems.
A mental illness such as depression or anorexia nervosa can affect body weight and function.
It is important to approach "health" as a whole, rather than its different types.
2.1.4	Factors of Good Health  
Health depends on a wide range of factors.
A person is born with a range of genes, and in some people, an unusual genetic pattern can lead to a less-than-optimum level of health.
Environmental factors play a role. Sometimes the environment alone is enough to impact health. Other times, an environmental trigger can cause illness in a person who is genetically susceptible.
Access to healthcare plays a role, but the WHO suggests that the following factors may have a bigger impact on health than this:
•	the state of the surrounding environment
•	genetics
•	income
•	education level
•	where a person lives
•	relationships with friends and family
These can be summarized as:
•	The social and economic environment: Including how wealthy a family or community is
•	The physical environment: Including parasites that exist in an area, or pollution levels
•	The person's characteristics and behaviors: Including the genes that a person is born with and their lifestyle choices
According to the WHO, the higher a person's socioeconomic status (SES), the more likely they are to enjoy good health, a good education, a well-paid job, afford good healthcare when their health is threatened.
 
2.2	Case Study
Nora health is health hospital that patient can visit to their place and established in 2016, it locates in Mogadishu Somalia. The Administer of this health is Dr Hassan Addow . 
Nora health are using Microsoft excel to keep their document and is not safe their  data like doctors records and staff salaries, this system will be help more professional easy ways that they can understand and safety.
Nora health wants to be leading first choice of health centers in Somalia envision creating a functional, management Nora health with is responsive to the needs of the patients’ convenient. 
The mission of Nora health expertise, quality services and increase the service and the work they as daily routine that reach all Somalia states.
2.3	Comparing Between Existing Systems  
Many health websites uses today online health systems and also there is international web apps that solve all health critical as one way solution and they had some differences between the characteristics of their websites so here the researcher compare some of them with our system.
doctors.practo.com (health management system) Practo Ray has 10,000+ doctors on the system. Over 10 million electronic patient records (doubling every year) have been created, over 7.5 million unique patients and over 7 million appointments are being made every year. In Singapore, Practo Ray is also the largest online clinic management software provider in terms of market share, reaching this milestone less than 2 years after launch.
Practo.com has over 1, 00,000 doctors listed from over 310 Indian towns and cities, with comprehensive coverage from the metros of Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Chennai, Pune and Singapore. It has over 1.3 million page views and 30,000 appointments booked every month, with traffic growing at 24 per cent per month. The company has seven offices, in Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, Pune and Singapore. In terms of revenue, Practo has been growing at 50-100%.

Health integrated financial management (health so)
This web application developed for doctors/admin/staff/patients to provide complete solutions for health management and financial as well as patients through a single get way using the internet as the sole medium. It will enable patients to order online appointment/tests/result/online doctor recommendation and admin/doctors/staffs go to browse through the website app and get them online requested orders without 
Having to visit patients to the health building physically. It is used PHP & MySQL for designing & implementing the Proposed System for Nora health clinic.

 
The features which are available in this new system are: -
	easy to manage and time saving 
	Very secure without internet hacks 
	Easy to use and super role based on permissions 
	Reliable and accurate and more efficiency
	Power full

Here are the comparing features of the previous discussed three systems.

2.4	Chapter Summery  
This chapter  discussed many features that directly related system’s effective work and compared this system other international systems like practo and that could show you how our community go with new world development. And that is will overthrow the old traditional manually system and is not very efficient, a lot of paper work has to be done, receipt, and take a long period of time to prepare. 
The chapter II has discussed all the related literature review from previous study to understand more about the meaning issue surrounding HIMS (Online health Integrated Managements System). Starting from presenting the overview of the System that basically includes several definitions, compare between existing systems.

Chapter Three
Software Development 
3.0	Introduction  
This chapter will deeply explains the operational faces of system requirement analysis. It includes illustrations, drawing and many features about functional requirement of FIHMS (financial integrated health management system) Based on the existing requirements. This chapter will also introduce the current system, and also will talk about the software development methodology which illustrates more points like the Operational Framework, Work break down structure (WBS), System Requirement, Problem Analysis Identification, and Requirements Gathering Techniques, Process Modeling, Data Modeling, Suitable Solution Strategy of the proposed system, and System Feasibility. Finally, this chapter will be concluded with chapter summery.
3.1	Operational Frame work  
In the system will be proposed by prototyping model that will be fascinating and understand the requirements.
 Prototyping is an attractive idea for complicated and large systems for which there is no manual process or existing system to help determine the requirements.
Phases of prototype:
•	Plan system (how system will be looks like - look and feel)
•	Analyze (re-think system requirements costs time and so on ) 
•	Determine Objectives 
•	Develop
•	Refine
•	Demonstrate
•	Test 
•	Implement
Advantages of Prototyping process model:
•	Reduced time and costs.
•	Improved and increased user involvement.
•	Errors can be detected much earlier as the system is mode side by side.
Disadvantages of Prototyping process model:
•	Insufficient analysis.
•	User confusion of prototype and finished system.
•	Developer misunderstanding of user objectives.
•	Developer attachment to prototype.


3.2	Work Breakdown Structure 
The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a view into the project which shows what work the project encompasses.






	








Figure 3.1 Work break down structure (WBS)
3.3	System Requirement 
The specific requirement of this system is 
•	Computer with HDD 500 and 4ram 2 Cpu or above 
•	Pre-installed OS and Xampp software with PHP version 7.3
•	Pre-installed Composer Laravel 5.5 and obove 
•	NodeJS with Npm V5.6 and above 



3.3.1	System Requirement Specification   
A software requirements specification (SRS) is a description of a software system to be developed. It lays out functional and non-functional requirements, and may include a set of use cases that describe user interactions that the software must provide. Software requirements specification shows the software needs of Nora health clinic center.
Table 3.1 Software Requirement of the system
Requirements



Front End	
PHP framework Laravel 5.5 html5/boostrap4/npm nodejs/jquery/js
Back End	MySQL
Browser	Any Browser

3.3.2 User Requirement Specification  
Since the current system of the health centers is not sufficient to fulfill the needs of its patients and health managers, and the new system of website will be expected to handle all tasks automatically in connecting the patients and take key and easily way to them in an online platform. The new online health management system website will have friendly GUI, flexibility, efficient environment, error tolerant and some security features. 
The user requirements of the system: create account of new health, and login, create patients, doctor, payment, tests, appointments, prescriptions, measurements, roles, permissions, accounts, chart of accounts, journal, ledger, doctor profile, patient profile.
3.4 	Problem Analysis Identification 

Nora health clinic is currently using Microsoft excel to register their daily list patients and they use too another excel to manage their daily income and the researcher aware of excel is not big scale database you may can use one sheet per day and tomorrow another sheet that would be worst, so that this web app will maintains all the information manually transferring, searching, updating, inserting transection will be implemented through the system.  
3.5	 Requirement Gathering Techniques    
Requirement gathering techniques or data gathering is a step-by-step problem solving technique used to analyze information system domain without any regard that the system being analyzed be either manual-based information system or computer-based information system. In order to change the old system and develop a new system it is important to get full information related to what you are going to develop, because the more you get full and accurate information, the more you result becomes the most suitable one. So there are many standard methods that the system analyst can follow. This research uses interviews and observation methods.

3.5.1	 Interview     
 Interview is a conversation where questions are asked and answers are given. In common parlance, the word "interview" refers to a one-on-one conversation
 Interview has many advantages Such as:
a) With open-ended interviews, the interviewer may obtain rich details and new insights.
b) Open-ended interviews allow the interviewer to ask the respondent for additional information.
c) The respondent is able to raise the issues she or he feels are important and express ideas in his or her own words.
Interview has disadvantages here are some of them
a) Open-ended interviews may be expensive and time-consuming to conduct and transcribe.
b) Open-ended interviews may require an outside evaluator for assistance with methods and analysis.
c) Open-ended interviews may challenge with privacy.
The researcher deeply understands after long time taken interview with client of Nora Health Clinic that they need the system that have with their specific needs.
3.5.2	 Observations    
The researcher observation was based on facts which are both accurate and detailed, but left any irrelevant or trivial information that makes the description difficult to understand. This data allows the reader to fully understand the situation. This method was ideal for gathering data to user-centered issues, such as the reliability of the Apartments system. They are also ideal for providing information about the impact and uses of the system in real-time settings.
Here are some of the advantages of observation:
a) Observers document program activities as they are happening, rather than relying on memories of the events.
b) Participant’s observation may build the skill levels of participants, and allow participants to raise issues about the program.
c) Observations often provide qualitative data, but can also provide quantitative data if checklists are used for recording relevant information.
Here are some of the disadvantages of observation:
a) With participant’s observation, a skilled facilitator is needed to participants present a critical evaluation.
b) Confidentiality of participants must be considered.
c) Evaluator observation may be expensive and time consuming.
The researcher understand how the local client still struggling with traditional file booking problem for that reason some observation still showing how these people could be easy solvable if there is huge maintained system could serve as online and track their patients records daily.

3.6	 Process Modeling     
This Application will use process modeling in this application DFD & UML to overview how way can be easy finish the deadline production of the application DFD is data flow diagram that will show how way your system features connected each other, while UML is unified modeling language.
3.6.1 Data Flow Diagram 
Data flow diagram (DFD) is a graphical representation of the “flow” of data through an information system, modeling its process aspects. Often they are a preliminary step to create an overview of the system which can later be elaborated. DFDs can also be used for the visualization of data processing (Structured design). DFDs help system designer and others during initial analysis stages visualize a current system or one that may be necessary to meet new requirements. Systems analysts prefer working with DFDs, particularly when they required a clear understanding of the boundary between existing systems and postulated systems.
	The hierarchical DFD typically consists of a top-level diagram (Level 0) underlain by cascading lower level diagram (Level 1, Level 2…) that represent different parts of the system. In the late 1970s data-flow diagrams (DFDs) were introduced and popularized for structured analysis and design (Gane and Sarson 1979). DFDs show the flow of data from external entities into the system, showed how the data moved from one process to another, as well as its logical storage. Figure 1 presents an example of a DFD using the Gane and Sarsen notation. There are only four symbols:
 
Figure 3.2 Gane and Sarson Symbols of DFD
3.6.2	 UML (Unified Modeling Language)    
UML is ‘language used for specifying not a method or procedure. The UML is used to define a software system; to detail the artifacts in the system, to document and construct – it is the language that the blueprint is written in. The UML may be used in a variety of ways to support a software development methodology (such as the Rational Unified Process) - but in itself it does not specify that methodology or process. In the event that UML is opted, object – oriented analysis will be used to describe the information system including the object modeling terms and concepts, like objects, attributes, methods, messages, classes, and instances, use case diagram, class diagram, state and showing relationships among objects and the concepts of inheritance through object relationship diagram.
3.6.2	 Use Case Diagram     
Use case diagrams describe what a system does from the standpoint of an external observer. The emphasis is on what a system does rather than how.
Here are the Symbols of UCD: -
 
Figure 3.4: Use Case Diagram Symbols.
Use case diagrams are closely connected to scenarios Actors represent roles, that is, a type of user of the system; Use cases represent a sequence of interaction for a type of functionality. 
 
Figure 3.5 Use Case Diagram (UML).


3.7.1	 Data Modeling    
Data modeling is the process and analysis of data and objects that are used in business or other context and identification of the relationship among these data objects. Data modeling is the first step in doing object oriented programming and involves professional data modelers working closely with business stakeholders, as well as potential users of information system so ERD is the selected data modeling technique for FIHMS designing phase of system.

3.7.2	 Entity Relationship Diagram     
ERD is a detailed, logical representation of the entities, associations and data elements for an organization or business. ERD is a graphical modeling tool to standardize ER modeling; the modeling can be carried out with the help of pictorial representation of entities, attributes and relationships. The basic building blocks of ERD are Entity, Attributes, Relationship and Lines entity is an object that exists and is distinguishable from other object in other words.
3.7.3	 Entity Relationship Diagram Symbols
ER diagram is used to represent database schema, here are some symbols used to represent ERD symbols:
 
3.7.4	 Types of Relationships    
Relationship is an association among one or more entities. This relationship can be broadly classified in to one – to – one relation, one – to – many relation, and many – to – many relation and recursive relation. The following table shows the symbols of the different relationship types.
 
3.7.5	 Entity Relationship Diagram    
 






3.8	 Suitable Strategy of Proposed System     
The researcher observation about the existing system’s problem that I have underlined previous 




Chapters then now I determined to build up a new system, which suits as well the needs of the Nora health clinic center. My theory is strong-willed to develop online health management system using the following as solution strategy for the problem: 
PHP laravel as front end MySQL as back end, Because PHP has power full set of Web development tools and its free source. It is powerful, designed to create dynamic and interactive HTML pages for your World Wide Web or corporate internet.
3.9	 System Feasibility     
The feasibility study technical information and cost data to determine the economic potential and practicality of a project. The feasibility study uses techniques that help evaluate a project and/or compare it with other projects. Feasibility study is a part of the system development life cycle, which aims to determine whether it is sensible to develop some system
Feasibility study is divided in to four types: -
 
	Technological feasibility
	Operational feasibility
	Economic feasibility
	Schedule feasibility
 
3.9.1	 Technical Feasibility     
Technical feasibility is the measure of the practically of a specific technical information system solution and the availability of technical resource to develop, purchase, install and operate the system often new technologies are solutions looking for a problem to solve. The assessment is based on an outline design of system requirements in terms of input, process, output, fields, programs, and procedures.
This can be counted in terms of volumes of data, trends, frequency of updating, etc. in order to estimate whether the new system will perform sufficiently or not. Technological feasibility is carried out to determine whether the company has the capability, in terms of software, hardware, personal and expertise, to handle the completion of the project.
A Hardware feasibility is shown in the below table
Table 3.2 Hardware feasibility

No	Item Description 	Quantity	Cost Per Unit	Amount
1	Laptop Corei3 	1	$370.00	$370.00
3	USP Mercury 1000	1	$16.00	$16.00
Total	$386.00
A Software feasibility is shown the below table
Table 3.3 Software feasibility
No	Item Description	Quantity	Cost Per Unit	Amount
1	PHP 	1	Free	
2.	MYSQL	1	Free	
Total	Free
3.9.2	 Operational Feasibility     
Operational feasibility register to measure of how the people are able to work with the system. This type of feasibility demands if the system will work when developed and installed. Since website is very user friendly so users will find it comfortable to work on this site. The following table will show the training cost of the user of the system.
Table 3.4 Operational feasibility
Activities	Duration	Expected Cost
Training Current Employee	2 Week	$200.00
Training New Employee	2 Week	$320.00
Total	$520.00

3.9.3	 Economic Feasibility 
Economic analysis is the most frequently used evaluating the effectiveness of proposed system, more commonly known as benefit analysis. The benefit analysis is to determine benefits and saving which are expected from candidate system and compare them with cost. If the benefits are more than the cost, the decision is made to design and implement the system. The cost and benefits may be direct or indirect and tangible or intangible.
  Economic feasibility is shown in the below table
Table 3.5 Economical feasibility
Types of feasibility	Description	Expect Cost
Technical feasibility	Hardware & software 	$200.00
Operational feasibility	Training with best option	$300.00
Total	$1020.00

3.9.4	 Schedule Feasibility     
Typically, this means estimating how long the system will take to develop, and if it can be completed in a given time period using some methods like payback period. Schedule feasibility is a measure of how reasonable the project timetable. This involves questions such as how much time is available to build the new system, when it can be built, whether it interferes with normal business operation, number of resources required, dependencies, can the system be developed in time etc. The project duration schedule is explained in the following table.
Table 3.6: Schedule feasibility of the new system
Level	Phase name	Duration 
1	Plan phase 
	3 weeks
2	Analysis Phase 	2 weeks
3	Design Phase 	1 weeks
4	Implementation and Testing	5 weeks
5	Operation and maintenance phase	2 weeks

3.10	 Chapter Summery   

In this Chapter, will be discussed important points on the Introduction, Operational framework, work break down, system requirements, software requirements specification,  User Requirement definition, problem analysis definition, requirements gathering techniques, interview, observation, process modeling, data flow diagram (DFD), unified modeling language (UML), use case diagram(UCD), data modeling, entity relationship diagram, ERD symbols, types of relationship, ERD of the proposed system, suitable solution strategies of the proposed system, system feasibility, technical feasibility, operational feasibility, economic feasibility, schedule feasibility.

CHAPTER FOUR
SOFTWARE DESIGN


4.1 Introduction
 The main goal of the system is to deliver the requirements as specified in the feasibility report. System design involves first logical design and then physical construction of the system. The logical design describes the structure and characteristics of features, such as the outputs, inputs, files, databases, and procedures. The physical construction produces actual program software, files, and a working system. The design goes through two phases of development: -
   1. Logical Design
   2. Physical Design
4.2 Architectural Design






1. Patient
2. Doctor
3. Administrator
4. Staff
 
The Patients will register himself with system initially by providing the various personal details that includes his name, age, sex ,etc., along with the doctor’s name with which he wants to consult ,if at all. The registration part is mandatory before the user is able to use the system for his task completion. Then the user proceeds with login using his/her unique id and password. 
(_name _gender _birthdates _country _state _address)
 
The role of doctor is vital to any healthcare process and would provide the provision in our project to get doctors feedback .The patient should be able to send the report to the doctor, who was specified by the customer during his/her registration. But this functionality should be entirely upon the discretion of the user that whether he/she chooses doctor’s analysis or not. If the customer feels, he/she is satisfied with his improvement and performance after monitoring the data provided by our application, then patient can logout of the system.
  
The role of administrator should be limited to the validation of authenticity of the patient or the doctor. The parameters that admin would use for validating the authenticity of the doctors are external to the project and not in its scope.
 The role of Staff should be limited to the lab process of patients and entry to the system result from doctor to the patients after analysis, working with doctor to make doctor’s activity easy of the patient. The parameters that staff would use for specific permissions that would be under main doctor and will act health nurses that always helps to the doctors.

4.3	USER INTERFACE DESIGN 
Interface design is the process of defining how the system will interact with the external entities “system users or other systems”. It describes the layout of the pages and the flow of events, and is also concerned with where and how data are represented on the pages.  However, in a User Interface Design, the needs, experience, and capabilities of the system users must be taken into account. In addition, the designers should be aware of users’ physical and mental limitations 
“E.g. limited short-term memory” and should recognize that people make mistakes.
The user of this digital system doesn’t need any software to install, but only requires a browser interface to access it. The optimal resolution setting to view the system will be 1000 x 750 and 800 x 600 pixels re. The software would be fully compatible with Microsoft Internet Explorer and Mozilla Fire Foxx for version 6, version 7, and version 8 and above.
To access the system, users will be required to have login through web browsers.
 Figure 4.1 System Interface
4.4	DATA STORAGE DESIGN 
Data storage is backend where all data will be sent back after manipulation design for database hierarchy for using MySQL with relational database management system Provides minimum data retrieving when locating specific records or all. That will provide Stores data in the most efficient manner possible to keep the database from growing too large, Makes data updates as easy as possible and creating more flexible enough to allow inclusion of new functions required of the program.
4.5 DATABASE DESIGN 
Database design process integrates relevant data in such a manner that is can be processed through a mechanism for recording the facts. A database of an organization is an information repository that represents facts about the organization. The database design is a complex process. The complexity arises mainly because of the identification of relationships among individual components and their representation for maintaining correct functionality are highly involved. The complexity increases if there are many-to-many relationships among individual components.

4.5.1.1	Database Normalization
Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database. This includes creating tables and establishing relationships between those tables according to rules designed both to protect the data and to make the database more flexible by eliminating two factors:
1-	redundancy 
2-	Inconsistent 
3-	Dependency. 
Redundant data wastes disk space and creates maintenance problems. If data that exists in more than one place must be changed, the data must be changed inexactly the same way in all locations. Inconsistent dependencies can make data difficult to access; the path to find the data may be missing.
Normalization is the analysis of functional dependencies between attributes. It is the process of decomposing relations with anomalies to produce well-structured relations. Well-structured relation contains minimal redundancy and allows insertion, modification, and deletion without errors or inconsistencies. Normalization is a formal process for deciding which attributes should be grouped together in a relation. It is the primary tool to validate and improve a logical design so that it satisfies certain constrains that avoid unnecessary duplication of data. 
Normalization theory is based on concepts of normal forms. A relational table is said to be a particular normal form if it satisfied a certain set of constraints. 

Purpose of normalization
Normalization allows us to minimize insert, update, and delete anomalies and help maintain data consistency in the database.
	To avoid redundancy by sorting each fact within the database only once
	To put data into the form that is more able to accurately accommodate change
	To avoid certain updating "anomalies"
	 To facilitate the enforcement of data constraint
	To avoid unnecessary coding.
The degree of normalization is defined by normal forms. The normal forms in an increasing level of normalization are first normal form (1NF), second normal form (2NF), and third normal form (3NF). Each normal form is a set of conditions on a schema that guaranties certain properties relating to redundancy and update anomalies.
Firstly the data is un-normalized form as it’s for the following

A table is said to be in First Normal Form (1NF) if and only if every entry of the table (the Intersection of row and column) has at most single value.
The table is said to be first normal form if have the following characteristics 
•	Un normalized data in the first table has been listed to gather
•	A key that will uniquely identify each record should be assigned to the table

Normalization is a process of creating table designs by assigning specific fields or attributes to each table in the database. Working with a set of initial table designs, you use normalization to develop an overall database design that is simple, flexible and free from data redundancy. Normalization involves applying a set of rules that can help you identify and correct inherent problems and complexities in your table designs. 

Conclusion
Normalization of Database can decrease redundancy, increase efficiency and reduce anomalies by implementing three of seven different levels of normalization called Normal Forms. The first three NF’s are usually sufficient for most small to medium size applications. Finally, we conclude our data normalization by identifying primary key and foreign key across all relations as following.
 

Figure: 4.21Database Diagram

4.5.1.2	Transforming E-R Diagram Into Relations
An entity-relationship (ER) diagram is a specialized graphic that illustrates the interrelationships between entities in a database. ERD show entities in a database and relationships between tables within that database. It is essential to have one of these if you want to create a good database design. The patterns help focus on how the database actually works with all of the interactions and data flows, although another useful tool is a Data Flow Diagram (DFD) which more directly describes this.
ERD is a detailed, logical representation of the entities, associations and data elements for an organization or business. ERD is a graphical modeling tool to standardize ER modeling; the modeling can be carried out with the help of pictorial representation of entities, attributes and relationships.
The basic building blocks of ERD are Entity, Attributes, Relationship and lines entity is an object that exists and is distinguishable from other object in other words,
 The entity can be uniquely Identified examples of entity are:   
	A particular  person, e-g  Mahad
	A particular reason, e-g heart pain
	A particular health, e.g. Noora health
Entity types or Entity set is a collection of similar entities; an entity may belong to more than one entity type.
A relationship is an association of entities where the association includes one entity from other particular types is meaningful association before entity types.
Attributes are properties of entity types in other words; entities are described in a data base by a set of attributes.
4.5.1.2.1	ERD Symbols
The ERD is used to represent database schema, here are some symbols used to represent ERD Symbols:
	A rectangle represents anEntity. 
	An Ellipse represents an Attribute. 
	A diamond represents a Relationship
	Lines represent linking of attributes to entity sets & of entity sets to relationship sets.
4.5.2.2 Types of Relationships






Relationship is an association among one or more entities. This relationship can be broadly classified into one-to-one relation, one-to-many relation, many-to-many relation and recursive relation.
	One to many Relationship Type: Abbreviated 1:M, the relationship that associate one entity to more than one entity is called one to many relationship: -  Example is country having states for one country there can be more than one states hence is an example one too many relationship.
	One to one Relationship Type: Abbreviated 1:1, one to one relationship is a special case of one too many relationships. True one to one relationship is rare. The relationship between the president and     Country is an example is one to one relationship.
	Many to Many Relationship Type: Abbreviated M: M, the relationship between EMPLOYEE entity and PROJECT entity is an example of many to many relationships. Many employees will be working in many projects hence the relationship between employee and project is many to many relationships.
	Many to One Relationship Type: Abbreviated M: 1, the relationship between Doctors and Patients is an example of many to one relationship, there may be Patients working in one relationship between doctors and patients is many to one relationship.

De-normalization 
Demoralization is the process of taking a Normalized database and modifying table structures to allow controlled redundancy for increased database performance. Attempting to improve performance is the only reason to ever de-normalize a database. A de-normalized database is not the same as a database that has not been normalized.
 De-normalizing a database is the process of taking the level of normalization within the	
Altering the logical database design to include redundant data. Demoralization is a process where we can remerge child tables in order to complete some specific tasks.
4.5.1.3	Data Dictionary 
Data dictionary is a centralized store of information about database, it contains information about tables, fields, the table contained data type, primary key, index, the join which have been established, between those tables referential integrity cascades update, cascades delete, data dictionary also called “meta data”

4.5.1.5	DESIGNING FORMS AND REPORTS
The most effective method of online data entry is a form filling, in which a blank form that duplicates or resembles the source document is completed on the screen. The user enters the data and then moves to the next field. The form can have many control features such as menu bars, toolbars, dialog boxes, text boxes, command buttons, list boxes, scrollbars, drop-down, group boxes, check boxes, and more others.
4.7	CHAPTER SUMMARY 
We have discussed in this chapter for many things relate software design such as architectural design, user interface design, data storage design, database design, data normalization, transforming E-R diagrams into relations, data dictionary, design physical tables and designing forms and reports 






CHAPTER FIVE



SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION AND OPERATION


5.1	INTRODUCTION

	
The main phase of the system can be the implementation and the system’s development life cycle is successful implementation of new system design. Implementations simply mean converting new system design into operation. This is the moment of fact the first question that strikes in every one’s mind that whether the system will be able to give all the desires results as expected from system. The implementation phase is concerned with user Training and file conversion.
	
		
The goal of the implementation phase is to implement a system correctly, efficiently, and quickly on a particular set or range of computers, using particular tools and programming languages in financial integrated health system, no one can log in without any account. As researcher declared above, this System has different Users and different privileges, so if you login the administrator you see the privileges and do his/her role in this system. 

5.2	DEVELOMENT PHASE

When the design is complete, most of the major decisions about the system have been made. What is next is to translate the design of the system into code in a given programming language; this phase is called Coding Phase. For the researcher design in chapter 4, the goal of this phase is to implement the design in the best possible manner. The coding phase affects both testing and maintenance strongly. A well written code reduces the testing and maintenance effort.


5.3	TEST SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION


This system has been tested during the development process. All the function has been tested separately to get the expected result and also has been tested with other functions to check its functionality to correct both logical errors and syntax errors. If there were errors, they were corrected in early phases of the development life cycle. However after the completion of the system, all function will be tested as a complete system to make sure that it meets its requirements and objectives.



5.3.1	Component Testing


In Personal Computer programming, unit testing is a method by which individual units of source code are tested to determine if they are fit for use. A unit is the smallest testable part of an application. In procedural programming a unit may be an individual function or procedure.
5.3.1.2	The Patients Page


The new system of financial integrated health system contains too many pages sequential to each other as the sequential process flow of the health clinic services the first page is either the patients or other staffs home page are  below.

 

Figure 5.1 Patients Page


5.3.1.3	Log in page

The Logging page is first landing one of the project which checks the user of the system if it is admin, user or patients, if it’s unauthorized person tries to login with unknown user nothing will be happen but if other one try existed user with wrong keys more than 5 attempt the system will automatically block that person’s user and it will force to wait 5 minute and then retry it 
So in order to login correctly First write your email and password then click log in button to log the system. If you enter invalid email or password you cannot log in the system. If you want to terminate click cancel. One thing must be mentioned if you create email type as Admin you can see and change all form in the project.

If you create user role as patients or staffs you cannot see all side bar listed roles and other credentials but your privilege is limited according to Admin in my case users as a type patients cannot see role or payment methods and many other features.
 
Figure 5.2 Login Page

5.3.1.4	Patients Registration 

This form is intended to register the patients and giving authentication for the access the system after they successfully registered patients doesn’t need admin verification it will be auto activate role.

5.3.1.6	Creating role as an admin
5.3.1.7	This form is intended to register new roles like admin role patient’s role and other staffs role.
 

Figure 5.4 Ruling page  
5.3.1 Integration Testing


Integration testing: is the phase in software testing in which individual software modules are combined and tested as a group. It occurs after unit testing and before system testing. Integration testing takes as its input modules that have been unit tested, groups them in larger aggregates, applies tests defined in an integration test plan to those aggregates, Testing more than one  program that depend on each other is called integration testing, or link testing.




5.3.1	Acceptance Testing


In this system we have shown all components and its functionalities by the users, whether we have met their requirements or not and they declared to be a successfully completed as they desire.



5.4	DEVELOPING DOCUMENTATION


In computer software product development, documentation is the information that describes the product to its users. It consists of the product technical manuals and online information (including online versions of the technical manuals and help facility descriptions). The term is also sometimes used to mean the source information about the product contained in design documents, detailed code comments, white papers, and blackboard session notes.  The term is derived from the idea that engineers and programmers also is a general term for a multiplicity of documents in a chosen mix of media and with a certain collection. Purpose of documentation is the use to support a tool or a process. Classical documentation is a set of documents printed on paper.

5.4.1	User Documentation

Unlike code documents, user documents are usually far more different with respect to the source code of the program, and instead simply describe how it is used. In the case of a software library, the code documents and user documents could be effectively equivalent and are worth conjoining, but for a general application this is not often true. Typically, the user documentation describes each feature of the program, and assists the user in realizing these features.


A good user document can also go so far as to provide thorough troubleshooting assistance. It is very important for user documents to not be confusing, and for them to be up to date. User documents need not be organized in any particular way, but it is very important for them to have a thorough index. Consistency and simplicity are also very valuable. User documentation is considered to constitute a contract specifying what the software will do.




5.4.1.1	User Requirements:


•	The users who will use this software can be only either the administrator or the patients as clients including Create patients, staff registering, and pharma and other users Performance of this health system.
•	Users must have a basic knowledge about computer including Microsoft Office programs and internet usage particularly Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Mozilla Fire Fox.
•	They have to take a training of how to use the financial integrated health system.






5.4.1.2	User capabilities:

The important functions of the Administrator of the system can include:

•	Registering new Assistant.

5.4.1.3	User instruction


Once you access this system, the home page is displayed. As we have already mentioned only specific types of users can gain access of their differently specified roles by giving their correct emails and passwords to the login page. If another person try to access the system without login the system will give a notice message that tells to log in the system with a valid email and Password before continue.


5.5	CHAPTER SUMMARY

This chapter we briefly discussed many sections starting with the system introduction, Development Phase, Test system implementation, Development Documentation and Chapter Summary. And also these chapters focused on some Figures of this system have.





CHAPTER SIX



CONCLUSION AND ENHANCEMENT



6.1	INTRODUCTION

Financial integrated health system provides many services through all parts of Nora Health Clinic. It simplifies all the health tasks and saving their time by making the user requests and services towards their request electronically. The administrator has its own administrative pages to manage his/her operations. 


Some features in admin panel are Creating Patients with manage adding staffs adding equipment and drugs extend rules and system permissions getting summarized financial accounts such as ledgers chart of account and so many other features.


This web application is developed using technologies like PHP with LARAVEL FRAMEWORK as front end and MySQL Server as the backend. The system fully implements its required goals and requirements specified in the requirement specification and make the users to gain their required services, efficiently and time saving way.


6.2	OBJECTIVE ACHIEVEMENTS 


The objectives that we have Declared in chapter one and met this system solves all functionalities need as is showing below.

•	Complete data tracking and access everywhere with Auth.
•	Flexible API’s with other devices such as smartphone ups and other full features.
•	The system saves all operational data in safe separate database file.
•	It can be used concurrently more than one user and receiving their responses rapidly.
•	Provides simple user friendly graphical user interface (GUI) to the end users.



6.3	WEAKNESS AND PROBLEM OF THE SYSTEM

•	Less android connectivity with patient features
•	Sometime heavy load balances.
•	Large JSON reading from server and un-efficient tables to preview.

6.4	STRENGTHS OF THE SYSTEM


As every system developed is, this system has more strength. The researcher will state some of them. Financial integrated health system solved most the health clinic problems of the Nora Health Clinic and the user requirements by providing smooth user friendly online interfaces. The system provides explanatory error messages that guide the user to the right way if it is misused. 




6.5	FUTURE WORK

As the researcher declared earlier that this system was developed with the latest technologies, if it is required extra improvement or enhancement, just you can extend the researcher analysis and design which he had made extensible for future use again. To use the code of the system, you require knowing laravel PHP coding skill and MySQL.
